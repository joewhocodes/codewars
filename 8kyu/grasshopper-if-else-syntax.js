// While making a game, your partner, Greg, decided to create a function to check if the user is still alive called checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive. Unfortunately, Greg made some errors while creating the function.

// checkAlive/CheckAlive/check_alive should return true if the player's health is greater than 0 or false if it is 0 or below.

const checkAlive = health => health > 0;
